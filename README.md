# Slope

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Slope  
**Author:** Pirate-Emperor

## Description

Slope is a comprehensive repository developed by Pirate-Emperor that focuses on generating slope maps from various lunar models, including Lunar_ISR, Crater_Detection, Height_Map, DTM_3D, and Hazard_Map. This project combines the outputs of these models to create detailed slope maps of the lunar terrain. Slope maps are valuable for understanding the topography of the Moon and are essential for various lunar exploration and research applications.

## Models Integration

Slope integrates the following models to derive slope maps:

1. **Lunar_ISR:** Enhances the resolution of lunar images to provide clearer details.
2. **Crater_Detection:** Identifies and outlines impact craters on the lunar surface.
3. **Height_Map:** Generates high-resolution lunar height maps for accurate topographic information.
4. **DTM_3D:** Estimates the depth information of lunar terrain from 2D images.
5. **Hazard_Map:** Identifies potential hazards on the lunar surface.

## Features

1. **Comprehensive Slope Mapping:** Slope combines the outputs of various models to create comprehensive slope maps, capturing both terrain features and potential hazards.

2. **Customizable Parameters:** Researchers and users can adjust parameters to fine-tune the slope map generation process based on specific research requirements.

3. **Integration Support:** Slope provides APIs and integration support for seamless incorporation into lunar exploration applications and workflows.
